# Restaurant Page

This project was my first experience building a website using Webpack (and npm packages).
While the new project layout was daunting at first, once I learned the benefits of bundlers
and npm packages it became clear why we need all these files that are produced after running
`npm init -y`. Using plugins and loaders for our non-javascript files (such as HTML, CSS, and local image paths) was also quite a change. 

This project was also a great opportunity to practice my DOM manipulation. This project only
includes Javascript code. All the HTML elements and CSS styles are added via the DOM. The tabs
for the website simply remove the content of the current page and displays the content of the
requested page, instead of the tab switching the user to a different HTML file.

Finally, I got to use ESM Modules for the first time in this project. It was very *freeing* to neatly organize my javascript code into separate files. Importing and Exporting pieces of code in javascript seems quite useful.
